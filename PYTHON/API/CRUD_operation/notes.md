CRUD Operations:

1. **Create**: Adds new data or records to a database or storage system.
2. **Read**: Retrieves or views existing data from the database.
3. **Update**: Modifies or edits existing data in the database.
4. **Delete**: Removes existing data from the database.

CRUD operations are fundamental for managing persistent storage in applications.

### HTTP Methods for CRUD

- **POST**: Used to create new resources on the server. For example, submitting a form to add a new user.
- **GET**: Retrieves data from the server without modifying it. Used to fetch information, such as viewing a list of users.
- **PUT**: Updates existing resources or creates them if they do not exist. Commonly used to edit user details.
- **DELETE**: Removes resources from the server, such as deleting a user record.

These HTTP methods map directly to CRUD operations in RESTful APIs, enabling standardized communication between clients and servers.
